## Barrier Option Pricing Model
A barrier option is a type of derivative where the payoff depends on whether or not the underlying asset has reached or exceeded a predetermined price. A barrier option can be a **knock-out**, meaning it expires worthless if the underlying exceeds a certain price or be a **knock-in**, meaning it has no value until the underlying reaches a certain price. 

Barrier options are also considered a type of **path-dependent option** as the payoff is based on the underlying asset's price path. Using this fact, we can use Monte Carlo Simulation to simulate to generate different paths for stock prices and eventually using it to get the option's price.
